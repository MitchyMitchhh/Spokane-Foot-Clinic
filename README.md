Data Analysis in R for the Spokane Foot Clinic's Surgery Center

  This data was provided by Northwest Surgery Center - Spokane Foot Clinic. The data uses variables called “Disperse” (The amount of money given out to the three different doctors after the overhead expenses) “Collection” (the amount of money received before overhead expenses are paid) and the month at which the collection and dispersal was recorded. This data was taken over the course of 24 months, March 2016 through February 2018. The months were also split into the four yearly quarters, for later use during the tests.

  This analysis will be broken up into two different parts. The first part is a linear regression model that analyses the relationship between collection and dispersal. The second part being an ANOVA test comparing yearly quarters to the amount of dispersal the center received.
